# Formual_1_pit_stop_calculation
I am creating a project based in old data to create a optimal timing for the pit stop in different scenario.
My objective is to create a program that will predict and analyse the optimal number and timing of pit stops in an F1 race, based on the race data, tire usage, track type and conditions
This is a personal project which i decided to work on during my summer break Currently the project has no deadline and no time limitations.
In this program i will be ignoring the relation between tyre wear and lap time to keep it easier in start
